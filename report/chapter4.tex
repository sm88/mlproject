\section{Ideas Used From Class}
\label{ideas-from-class}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Apart from Vector Space Model, we have also used SVM and gaussian naive bayes classifier to solve this classification problem.
    \item We have measured the overall F1 score of the prediction to compare the
        performance of different classification algorithms.
\end{itemize}

\section{Concepts Learned in this project}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Learnt Vector Space model which is an algebrical model for representing
        text document as a vector of index terms. This is an widely used
        technique in information retrieval.
    \item Although we studied SVM and Gaussian naive bayes classifier in our
        class, in this project we learnt how to employ them in a practical
        problem like detection of emotion from text.
    \item During the course of this project, we also became familiar with
        tf-idf (term frequency-inverse document frequency) weighting scheme.
        This is an well known technique in information retrieval which gives us
        an idea about the importance of an word to a document in a corpus.
    \idea We also had a hands on experience with Weka which is a popular suite
    of machine learning algorithms. We used this tool mainly to visualize the
    training data and to test some standard classification algorithm.
    \item
