I was very eager to replace her in suffernig even die instead of her. 
joy#One Saturday afternoon I deliberately dressed up nicely I had been in a bad mood of late. I hoped to go for a walk in the soft sunlight to try and uplift my spirits.

sadness#After a meeting ended we started talking about when we would have the next discussion I had many tests the coming week and could not have a meeting in between I thought that they would understand this as they had always done.

anger#When I got into a bus I found that my wallet had been stolen. It was not a great loss from the monetary point of view but I lost some documents identity papers. As a result I had to spend several days in order to get a new one. I will always remember all the work I had to do and the bad treatment I suffered because of the bureaucratic behaviour of the civil servant. I had already had bad luck and they treated me like a criminal. At one point of time I really wanted to quarrel with them.

joy#I had a dream : I had a very close friend who had several stone houses in the New Territories villages but they did not have much furniture. He took me to see his fields I had never seen them before and there were several inches of clear water on which the sunshine was reflected. I wanted to sit among the short green plants in the fields but was afraid of treading the plants to death. My friend said They will not die and I sat down happily and my trousers did not get wet. 
anger#My friend often played a joke on me and sometimes I thought that he was a nonsensical person. Once when we went to a friends house he walked in first and shut the door firmly behind him. I felt that he did not respect me and moreover I was his friend so he should not have behaved like that. I was very angry as it is I was in a bad mood then. 
sadness#I suddenly found that those whom I considerered to be my good friends did not care for me. Although I could still be with them I felt unimportant.

I was sad when I decided that they were no longer my good friends. 
joy#During the exam period I studied in the library alone.

anger#I came across a girl at the school busstop I had seen her several friends as she was a friends friend.

It lasted several hours and only calmed down later. 
anger#In September 1984 I was forced to live with someone I did not like. The first week we were at loggerheads and our conversation was like a debate. The atmosphere was very bad. When he learnt that I had got 95 marks in a test he told me A failure You lost 5 marks. I was very angry not because my marks were lower than his but because I could not tolerate his pride. I did not show my discontentment and carried on doing my work. 
sadness#This issue worried me rather than saddening me. In mid September I went to Guanggho alone. I was looking for an accomodation in the evening and after having walked 2 or 3 miles I still could not find anything. What could I do? I was not worried about sleeping on the streets but because of some procedural problems. I finally found a place to sleep at 8 oclock. 
joy#I received a letter from a distant friend. 
anger#Two years back someone invited me to be the tutor of her granddaughter. The granddaughter asked me some questions in mathematics so I taught her. However she did not listen to me and this made me feel unhappy. The second year it was the same. When I entered university the girls parents suggested that I be employed as their daghters tutor. They told me that at university there was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they made a timetable for me which required me to be the tutor five days a week. They did not respect me and anyway I had another child to teach.
